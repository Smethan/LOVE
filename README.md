# FAQ

#### Can I run my LÖVE game on this?

Running your game without any changes is very unlikely, so it's recommended to currently use LövePotion to make games from the ground up.


#### Can I help?

Yes, see the [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://www.github.com/VideahGams/LovePotion/tree/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) for more details.

#### How do I build this?

Follow [this](https://github.com/VideahGams/LovePotion/wiki/Building-L%C3%96VEPotion) guide, building should work on
Linux, Windows and macOS if setup properly.

#### How do I load my game?
Games are loaded either from a `game` folder placed in the same directory as a built 3dsx, or
loaded directly from RomFS if LövePotion is built with a `game` folder in its directory.

#### How do I run this?

There are a ton of ways to run LövePotion.
[Start here!](http://smealum.github.io/3ds/)

**LövePotion** is developed using [Citra](http://citra-emu.org/) and [MenuHax](http://smealum.github.io/3ds/).

There are also other ways, but I know next to nothing of these methods.

To run your game in Citra, place your game folder in these locations:

| Platform | Path                            |
|----------|---------------------------------|
| Linux    | `~/.local/share/citra-emu/sdmc` |
| Windows  | `[CITRA-FOLDER]/users/sdmc`     |

#### Neat! I'm gonna send my game to Nintendo and get cartridge of my game and I'l-

Stop right there kiddo, this is for Homebrew only.

This is not for releasing a real 3DS title. I dunno, contact Nintendo if that's what you want.

#### Can I use this to run Mari0?
No.
