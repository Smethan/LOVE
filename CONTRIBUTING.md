# Contributing to LövePotion

Anyone can contribute to LövePotion, but there are a few guidelines.
### Pull Requests
 * Tabs for indentation, spaces are **the devil!**
 * No Allman style brackets please, they're ugly.
 * If you add an external library, please add the respective license to the license folder.
 * Accurately test your changes, if it's a change that improves performance for example, *make sure it actually improves performance!*
 * Codebase cleanups are very welcome, things are a mess right now.

### Issues
 * Please only create issues for LövePotion as a whole, if you need help making your game ask in the [GBATemp thread.](https://gbatemp.net/threads/release-l%C3%B6vepotion-l%C3%96ve-api-for-3ds-homebrew-beta.397559/)
 * Confirm the bug you are posting does indeed exist and you're not doing anything wrong.

That's all mostly, if you have any questions hit me up on `#lovepotion` on OFTC.
